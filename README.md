# Mobile first approach

In this code I have tested the difference in styling a mobile first site and how this then compares to the desktop and tablet. 

We work on HTML5 and CSS.

In using HTML5, we created link to two CSS files: main.css and main2.css. 

main.css contains the style for mobile then tablet then desktop to illustrate the changing in div colour when the width of the page increases.

main2.css contains the same styles as main.css but we changed the order of the media queries to test the importance of the order. Results showed that you need to pay attention to the width numbering as this could mean unintended overriding of styles.

Also remembered to upload to github as backup!
